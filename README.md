# legimi-gui

### An unofficial legimi ebook downloader for Linux made in Qt, based on tp86's backend.

**TODO**
- [ ] rewrite the backend in C++
- [ ] create GUI
- [ ] send books directly to kindle
- [ ] store login and password in something else then plain text
- [ ] multithreaded book download

#### **I am not affiliated with legimi in any way**
